# Estonian Salary Trends Application - Detailed Plan

Based on my exploration of the Statistics Estonia database and the requirements you've provided, I've created a detailed plan for developing the Estonian Salary Trends web application. This plan outlines the architecture, components, data flow, and implementation steps needed to create a comprehensive salary analysis tool.

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop a web application that enables users to analyze Estonian salary market data and understand salary trends across various sectors, with AI-generated summaries and forecasts.

**Timeline**: MVP within 1-2 weeks (tight timeline)

**Deployment**: Local deployment for personal or internal team use

## 2. Data Sources

From my exploration of the Statistics Estonia database, I've identified several valuable data tables that can be used for our application:

1. **PA107**: Average monthly gross wages, median wages, and number of employees by county (updated March 2025)
2. **PA51**: Average monthly gross and net wages (2000-2017, monthly data)
3. **PA5321**: Average monthly gross and net wages by county (2000-2017)
4. **PA118**: Average hourly gross wages by county (quarterly data)
5. **PA22**: Average hourly gross wages by county (2000-2018, quarterly data)
6. **PA5322**: Average hourly gross wages by county (2000-2017)
7. **PA5331**: Average monthly gross and net wages by kind of owner of an enterprise (2000-2017)

These tables provide comprehensive data on salaries across different regions, time periods, and sectors in Estonia.
